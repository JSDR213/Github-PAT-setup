# Github Personal Access Token Setup

In 2021, Github went through a large security update. There are a few new steps needed to get full authentication with a github account. Here is a detailed guide on how to generate and use the Personal Access Tokens that Github now requires.


### Step 1 - Creating Our First Repo

- At the top right of your Github page, click the grey Plus sign "+" and select "New Repository". This is how we create our own Github Repo's, and it is something we will be doing throughout the class.

- You will see a few options and prompts. Where it says "Respoitory Name", type in something simple, like "first-repo"

- Set this to Public, and select the box to Initialize with a ReadMe. This will allow us to Clone this repo down to use on our computers (we'll see what this means soon!)

- Do not worry about gitignores and licences, they are not relevent yet


- Once it lights up, click the big green button that says "Create Repository". You will be redirected to your new Github Repo, which we can clone down and work with!

- Towards the top-right of the page, you'll see another big green button that says "Code", with 3 options. We are going to copy that link in a few quick minutes


### Step 2 - Getting a Personal Access Token


- Open up a new tab on your browser and go to your github page. 

- Click on your profile picture and go to Settings

- At the bottom of the left hand menu, go to Developer Settings, then Personal Access Tokens, and click 'Tokens'

- Once at the Token page, click "Generate New Token". You will be given a menu of options to choose from. 

- Select "No expiration date" from the drop down menu, and click on each checkbox, to give yourself full priviliges for all of your repos and projects. Once you have them all selected, hit "Generate Token".
